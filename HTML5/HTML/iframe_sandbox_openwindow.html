<!-- 
The sandbox attribute enables an extra set of restrictions for the content in the iframe.

When the sandbox attribute is present, and it will:

treat the content as being from a unique origin
block form submission
block script execution
disable APIs
prevent links from targeting other browsing contexts
prevent content from using plugins (through <embed>, <object>, <applet>, or other)
prevent the content to navigate its top-level browsing context
block automatically triggered features (such as automatically playing a video or automatically focusing a form control)
The value of the sandbox attribute can either be empty (then all restrictions are applied), or a space-separated list of pre-defined values that will REMOVE the particular restrictions.
