The <textarea> tag defines a multi-line text input control.

The <textarea> element is often used in a form, to collect user inputs
 like comments or reviews.

A text area can hold an unlimited number of characters, and the text renders in a
fixed-width font (usually Courier).

The size of a text area is specified by the cols and rows attributes (or with CSS).

The name attribute is needed to reference the form data after the form is 
submitted (if you omit the name attribute, no data from the text area will be submitted).

The id attribute is needed to associate the text area with a label. 

Tip: Always add the <label> tag for best accessibility practices!
