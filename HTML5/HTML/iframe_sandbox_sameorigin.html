The <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.

An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.

Tip: It is a good practice to always include a title attribute for the <iframe>.
    This is used by screen readers to read out what the content of the <iframe> is.

<!-- 
The sandbox attribute enables an extra set of restrictions for the content in the iframe.

When the sandbox attribute is present, and it will:

treat the content as being from a unique origin
block form submission
block script execution
disable APIs
prevent links from targeting other browsing contexts
prevent content from using plugins (through <embed>, <object>, <applet>, or other)
prevent the content to navigate its top-level browsing context
block automatically triggered features (such as automatically playing a video or automatically focusing a form control)
The value of the sandbox attribute can either be empty (then all restrictions are applied), or a space-separated list of pre-defined values that will REMOVE the particular restrictions.

 <!-- using sandbox/allow-same-origin->Allows the iframe content to be treated as being from the same origin -->
 <!-- it will open index.html on same page rather than another tab -->
